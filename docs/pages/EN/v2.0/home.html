  Description
</h2>

<p>
  <span class="text-orange">Scripts Manager</span> is a tool for streamers, developers, but also anyone who wants to automate actions on their computer.
  <br />You can still use it as a toolbox so as not to redevelop software from A to Z if you are a <code>Java Scripts</code>/<code>NodeJS</code> developer.
  <br /><br />Do not hesitate to participate by sending me your suggestions via the <span class="text-orange">Discord</span> server of my <span class="text-orange">Twitch</span> channel: <a href="https://discord.gg/BNarUut7Kx" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/BNarUut7Kx</a>.
  <br />In case you develop <span class="text-orange">Addons</span> or <span class="text-orange">Scripts</span>, offer them for download from your <span class="text-orange">GitHub</span> account (I may add it in this documentation).
</p>

<h2>
  <a id="download" class="anchor" href="#download"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
  Download
</h2>

<p>
  The version is the one presented in this documentation: <a href="https://github.com/Arubinu/Scripts-Manager/releases/tag/v2.0.5" target="_blank">https://github.com/Arubinu/Scripts-Manager/releases/tag/v2.0.5</a>.
  <br />But you can check all versions here: <a href="https://github.com/Arubinu/Scripts-Manager/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/Arubinu/Scripts-Manager/releases</a>.
  <br /><br />You will find the software to download in the <code>Assets</code> part (this is not an installer but the complete software).
  <br />Put the software where you want to leave it before launching it, avoid folders where there is a request for administrator access (this software will never ask you for this kind of rights).
  <br /><br />It is possible that Windows recognizes the software as malicious, since I cannot afford a certificate (far too expensive).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If Windows blocks the download, you will need to temporarily disable your antivirus.</li>
  <li>If Windows deletes the file once downloaded, you can go to the quarantine part to authorize the software (it will be immediately put back in its place).</li>
  <li>When launching the software, Windows will warn you of the potential danger, you can click on <code>Additional information</code> then <code>Run anyway</code></li>
</ul>

  <br />These can be used via <span class="text-orange">Scripts</span> of your design or the <span class="text-orange">Multi Actions</span>.

  Limited connection
</h4>

<p>
  You just have to click on <code>Generate</code> to give access to your account and generate the tokens.
  <br />This method is very limited unless you send me your email address, so I can add it to the <span class="text-orange">Spotify</span> developer app.
</p>

<h4>
  <a id="extended-connection" class="anchor" href="#extended-connection"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
  Extended connection
</h4>

<p>
  You have to create yourself a developer application <span class="text-orange">Spotify</span>, without forgetting to enter your own email address to remove the limitations.
  <br />This application gives you the <code>Client ID</code> as well as the <code>Client Secret</code> to be able to generate the associated tokens.

<p>
  By clicking on <code>Toggle Blocks</code> you will have access to all the script blocks that you can use by dragging them into the module.

<h3>
  <a id="stream-flash" class="anchor" href="#stream-flash"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
  Stream Flash
</h3>

<p>
  Flash your screen when a message is sent in <span class="text-orange">Twitch</span> chat.
</p>

<img src="./images/screenshots/v2.0/stream-flash.webp" alt="" />

<p>
  The first line informs of the number of flashes occurred for the different types of user.
</p>

<p>
  <code>Screen to flash</code> leaves the choice of the screen on which to display the flash (often the one where <span class="text-orange">OBS Studio</span> is displayed).
  <br />The <code>Reset statistics</code> button resets the counters of the first line to zero.
</p>

<p>
  <u>Some settings:</u>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>Opacity:</u> so as not to obscure the information displayed on the screen too much.</li>
  <li><u>Duration:</u> is the time the flash takes to appear and disappear.</li>
  <li><u>Delay:</u> ignores messages during this time after a flash has occurred.</li>
  <li><u>Pause:</u> pauses the <span class="text-orange">Stream Flash</span> system for the chosen duration (accessible from the <span class="text-orange">Scripts Manager</span> icon on the systray).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <code>Respond to join</code> activates the flash when a user arrives on the stream (even without speaking).
  <br /><code>Respond to command</code> activates the flash when a command is sent on the <span class="text-orange">Twitch</span> chat.
</p>

</h3>

<p>
  Displays web pages on one of your screens.
  <br />Can be used to display its alerts, its <span class="text-orange">Twitch</span> chat, or other over a game (does not work on screens where a game is set to exclusive fullscreen).
</p>

<img src="./images/screenshots/v2.0/stream-widgets.webp" alt="" />

<p>
  <code>Screen for widgets</code> leaves the choice of the screen on which to display the web pages (often the main screen).
</p>

<p>
  <code>Anchor</code> allows to choose the base anchor of the page for the following values.
  <br /><code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>Width</code>, <code>Height</code> can be done directly from the <span class="text-orange">Scripts Manager</span> icon in the systray (with the <code>Edit Mode</code> option).
  <br />To exit edit mode, just press the <code>Escape</code> button on the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
  Indicate a name in the <code>Name</code> field then the address of the page to display in the <code>URL</code> field then click on <code>Create</code>.
  Once displayed, moving and resizing is done from the <code>Edit Mode</code> option mentioned previously.
